Today's world offers a variety of transportation options. However, in a case like a flood, there is
no other method to get around besides boats. An autonomous amphibious vehicle (AAV) with a
precise design that can move across both terrestrial and aquatic conditions is described. An
amphibious vehicle is a type of vehicle that can travel on both land and water. It is also sometimes
referred to as an amphibian. A vehicle with several uses is an amphibious vehicle. Regarding a
variety of uses, such as in the realm of military and rescue operations, it might be proposed for
commercialization. Researchers are developing an amphibious vehicle that can operate effectively
in challenging settings. The main distinction between this amphibious vehicle and others is the
wide range of sensors that are put into it to avoid running away with water. These sensors emit
infrared rays and echoes that aid in the detection of nearby objects and of hard objects like strong
trees or poles. In order to establish a steady support and prevent the vehicle from slipping away
with the water, a rope is thrown pneumatically after the pole is recognized. This allows the vehicle
to be utilized as both a travel and rescue vehicle. In order to survive even during late evenings and
if struck in any of the caves, there are also night vision sensors and oxygen tanks included in. It
can also be utilized to promote tourism so that people can visit canal sides. similar to a speedboat
or jansky trip. The engine and suspension will operate without issue because the car is totally
waterproof. To prevent rust, the wheels have been entirely galvanized. We use lightweight
materials to maximize mileage, and we employ a hybrid system that generates energy from
windblast to be helpful and reduce the likelihood of failure.
